//
// #### Introduction
//
// The Log Stream API manages LogStream resources which are used to stream
// writes and reads of an ordered sequence of bytes of unknown eventual length.
//
// Note that this is an API Interface and not an API Service, per the definitions
// at: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary
//
// Log Stream API supports the reading of unfinalized LogStreams either by
// seeking or in "tail" mode, for example by end-users browsing to a build
// result UI interested in seeing logs from a build action as soon as they are
// (or as they become) available.
//
// Reads and Writes of LogStreams are done via the Byte Stream API:
// https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rpc/google.bytestream
// https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/bytestream/bytestream.proto
//
// #### Writing LogStreams
//
// LogStreams are written to via the Byte Stream API's `Write` RPC. Bytes
// written to LogStreams are expected to be committed and available for reading
// within a reasonable period of time (implementation-defined). Committed bytes
// to a LogStream cannot be overwritten, and finalized LogStreams - indicated by
// setting `finish_write` field in the final WriteRequest - also cannot be
// appended to.
//
// When calling the Byte Stream API's `Write` RPC to write LogStreams, writers
// must pass the `write_resource_name` of a LogStream as
// `ByteStream.WriteRequest.resource_name` rather than the LogStream's `name`.
// Separate resource names for reading and writing allows for broadcasting the
// read resource name widely while simultaneously ensuring that only writer(s)
// with knowledge of the write resource name may have written bytes to the
// LogStream.
//
// #### Reading LogStreams
//
// Use the Byte Stream API's `Read` RPC to read LogStreams. When reading
// finalized LogStreams the server will stream all contents of the LogStream
// starting at `ByteStream.ReadRequest.read_offset`.
//
// When reading unfinalized LogStreams the server must keep the streaming
// `ByteStream.Read` RPC open and send `ByteStream.ReadResponse` messages as
// more bytes become available or the LogStream is finalized.
//
// #### Example Multi-Party Read/Write Flow
//
//  1. LogStream Writer calls `CreateLogStream`
//  2. LogStream Writer publishes `LogStream.name`
//  3. LogStream Writer calls `ByteStream.Write` with
//     `LogStream.write_resource_name` as
//     `ByteStream.WriteRequest.resource_name`,
//     `ByteStream.WriteRequest.finish_write`=false.
//  4. LogStream Reader(s) call `ByteStream.Read` with the published
//     `LogStream.name` as `ByteStream.ReadRequest.resource_name`.
//  5. LogStream Service streams all committed bytes to LogStream Reader(s),
//     leave the stream open.
//  6. LogStream Writer calls `ByteStream.Write` with
//     `LogStream.write_resource_name` as
//     `ByteStream.WriteRequest.resource_name`,
//     `ByteStream.WriteRequest.finish_write`=true.
//  7. LogStream Service streams all remaining bytes to LogStream Reader(s),
//     terminates the stream.
